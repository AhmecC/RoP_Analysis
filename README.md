# Lord of the Rings : Rings of Power [RoP]

The release of RoP sparked a significant divide among fans of Tolkien's work. Most pointed towards its 'unfaithfulness' to the source material as the culprit, and the varying degrees of tolerance by fans caused many debates. The subreddits r/LOTR_on_Prime, r/RingsofPower, r/lotr, r/lordoftherings radiated distinctly different sentiments to each other. This analysis aims to quantify these differences, and observe potential changes in sentiment as the 8 episodes were released.

Note:
