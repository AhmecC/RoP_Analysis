## Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
The release of *The Rings of Power* sparked a significant divide among fans of Tolkien's work. Criticism was directed at the show's writing and direction, and also notably at the show's 'unfaithfulness' to the source material. The varying degrees of tolerance by fans caused many debates. this analysis focuses on the subreddits r/LOTR_on_Prime, r/lotr, r/lordoftherings, r/RingsofPower and r/Rings_of_Power which all exuded distinctly different sentiments from each other. I aim to quantify and visualise these disparities and highlight changing trends as the show's 8 episodes were released.

## Skills Used
I utilised the **PRAW Package** to swiftly acquire Reddit comments from across 40 mega threads. Throughout my EDA, I demonstrated my adeptness in selecting appropriate visualisations via tools like **matplotlib** and **seaborn** to display data concisely. I showcased intuition by electing the **VADER** sentiment analyser to define the sentiment of the unlabelled comments. I leveraged my **mathematical** skills to devise a formula that weights the sentiment score based on comment upvotes. This enhancement allowed for a more accurate reflection of the subreddit sentiment.

## Extra Information
- Used Comments from megathread related to episodes from each subreddit
- Episode 1 & 2 are looked at jointly, since most subreddits joined these episodes megathreads
